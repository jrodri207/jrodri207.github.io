I want to pursue something more than what I am doing at my current job right now. I saw this program a while back and decided to make a effort and try to learn something new. Learning this will help me get out of the area I am in and strive to do better for myself. I realize this is only going to get bigger from here on out, this day and age is getting more advanced and has so much room to grow in the future. I want to hop on the train and learn from the best to be the best.
